# GenericSocketFramework: A TCP framework

The main idea of this project is to create a transport layer between the client and server which can be used by the JAVA programmer without writing any code of socket programming for data transfer. Everything that a programmer needs while creating any application based on client-server architecture and need to write the socket programming code for data transfer will be managed easily with the help of this framework.
